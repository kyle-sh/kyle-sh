### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**kyle-sh/kyle-sh** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I'm currently a student at Tech Elevator.
- I'm learning software development.
- Any help or advice is appreciated.
